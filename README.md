# health-for-all
I worked on a healthcare website that reccomends you the hospitals near you and also suggests doctors based on your symptoms. It also has a feature to save hospitals and also save appointments to hospitals, so you dont miss them. It is like a all in one spot that controls and manages your healthcare essentials.
